# Artup AI Trademark & Brand Usage Policy

Version: 1.0 (Initial Release)  
Established: 2025-09-13 (UTC)  
Status: Initial publication for evidence and reference

---
## 1. Purpose
This document formalizes permissible and restricted uses of the "Artup AI" wordmark and associated textual Brand Elements. It supports:
- Evidence of **continuous development**
- Clarification of **license boundary vs. trademark rights**
- Facilitation of **responsible community reference**
- Future **trademark filing preparation**

---
## 2. Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Wordmark | The textual brand identifier: "Artup AI" (with one space) |
| Brand Elements | Wordmark, approved color identifiers, taglines, messaging framework, typography specs |
| Nominative Use | Fact-based reference to the brand without implying affiliation |
| Confusing Use | Any usage likely to mislead about origin, sponsorship, or endorsement |

---
## 3. Ownership Statement
All goodwill associated with the Wordmark and Brand Elements accrues to Artup AI. Open publication does **not** waive present or future rights under trademark or unfair competition laws.

---
## 4. Permitted Uses (No Permission Required)
You MAY, without prior written consent:
1. Reference "Artup AI" in factual articles, comparisons, documentation, or commentary.
2. Quote official taglines verbatim with attribution.
3. Display unaltered wordmark text in compatibility notices (e.g., "Works with Artup AI").
4. Use code examples and CSS variable names (implementation mechanics covered by MIT License) provided you do not present them as proprietary styling for your own brand.
5. Include screenshots of textual documentation for review, education, or archival context.

Conditions: Must not (a) alter spacing, (b) stylize to imitate an official logo, (c) imply endorsement, partnership, certification, or official integration status unless explicitly granted.

---
## 5. Restricted Uses (Require Written Permission)
You MUST obtain permission before:
- Using the wordmark in product names, app titles, domain names (beyond nominative mention)
- Featuring the wordmark in primary marketing headers or hero graphics implying affiliation
- Selling merchandise containing the wordmark or its distinct combinations
- Bundling the Brand Elements into distributable design systems or commercial UI kits
- Translating or modifying taglines to create derivative branded slogans
- Using confusingly similar variants (e.g., "ArtUp AI", "ArtupAI" as branding)

---
## 6. Prohibited Uses (Will Be Actively Opposed)
- Registering trademarks, domains, or corporate entities that create confusion
- Presenting the brand as deprecated, compromised, or falsely affiliated
- Embedding the wordmark inside logos or composite marks without approval
- Obfuscating or removing attribution in redistributed documentation
- Creating false endorsements or fabricated integration claims

---
## 7. Technical Use of CSS Variables
The naming pattern (e.g., `--artup-primary`) is MIT-licensed as an implementation detail. However, **marketing or UI positioning implying official theme alignment** without context is not permitted.

---
## 8. Primary Color Strategy (Neutral Core)
The primary brand color is Deep Black `#0D0D0D`, intentionally selected as a non-saturated neutral core. This enables:
- Flexible adaptation across light/dark UI environments
- Avoidance of premature chromatic lock-in before full visual system release
- Clear semantic layering for accent hues (Electric Blue / Bright Purple)
- High contrast control for accessibility and future theming tokenization
Historical references should use the current canonical value unless explicitly documenting legacy experiments.
The standard wordmark itself is restricted to monochrome usage (Deep Black on light backgrounds / White on dark or accent backgrounds); accent hues are not applied directly to the base wordmark.

---
## 9. Evidence & Continuity Framework
Artifacts forming the evidence chain:
- `README.md` – Core definition
- `CHANGELOG.md` – Evolution log
- `BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` – Implementation specifics
- `TRADEMARK_POLICY.md` – Rights and usage governance
- `EVIDENCE.md` – Minimal index referencing the above (expandable later)

Each commit reinforces priority and continuity. Tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) function as notarized checkpoints.
